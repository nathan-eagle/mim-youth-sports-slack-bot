### Conversation Flow
```
Parent: "I need something for my daughter's soccer team"
MiM: "Perfect! Soccer teams love our gear. Are you thinking jerseys, warm-up clothes, or fan stuff like hats and bags?"

Parent: "Something the parents can wear to games"
MiM: "Great choice! Here are popular options for soccer parents: [shows polo, hoodie, hat]. What are your team colors?"

Parent: "Purple and gold"
MiM: "Love those colors! Here's how each would look in purple with gold accents [shows previews]. Ready to add your team logo?"
```
